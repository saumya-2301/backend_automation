GenAI based Backend Automation
he Idea
Imagine you want to set up a web server on your system. Instead of manually writing commands, just type:
💬 "Set up a web server for me."
And boom! 💥 The AI will:
✅ Fetch your OS details 🖥️
✅ Generate an optimized automation script 📜
✅ Execute the script automatically 🏗️

🔹 How It Works?
I used Google Gemini API to process user commands and convert them into OS-specific shell scripts. The architecture is:
🔹 Flask API for user interaction 🖥️
🔹 System info retrieval (Windows/Linux) ⚙️
🔹 Dynamic script generation via Gemini API 🧠
🔹 Auto-execution of commands ⚡

🔹 Key Features
✅ Works across Windows & Linux
✅ Supports multiple backend operations
✅ Uses natural language prompts
✅ Secure execution with validation

🔹 Potential Use Cases
💡 DevOps automation: Set up servers, databases, and cloud instances
💡 IT support: Automate troubleshooting and configurations
💡 System administration: Install software, create users, manage services

🔹 What’s Next?
I plan to extend this project by:
🔹 Adding function calling for API-based automation
🔹 Integrating Docker & Kubernetes support
🔹 Implementing multi-user authentication
